title: About Me
---

I'm a Kiwi expatriate currently residing in Australia where I work as a
sysadmin at [GitHub](http://github.com).  When I'm not fighting misbehaving
servers, you can find me either on a cycleway, at an archery range or at the
local pub.

If you want to get in contact, you can find me on 
[GitHub](http://github.com/rodjek), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rodjek),
via [email](mailto:tim@sharpe.id.au) or on `irc.freenode.net` as `rodjek`.
